Brush: Literate Programming Without Tangling
========================================================

Brush is a Scribble language similar to `scribble/lp2`, but with support for semi-literate programming in the tradition of Literate Haskell rather than full Knuth-style literate programming.

The Brush documentation is available at [the Racket docs site](https://docs.racket-lang.org/brush/index.html) or on your local machine following installation.
